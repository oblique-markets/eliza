/**
 * Deterministic peer-coherence gate for the spawned-worker Effect prerelease
 * family (#18810). Walks the real module-resolution chain the Smithers worker
 * uses — this plugin → smthrs → @smthrs/engine → @effect/platform-bun →
 * @effect/platform-node-shared — through Bun's isolated store, and fails when
 * any link's declared dependency or peer range on `effect` (or on another
 * family member) is not satisfied by the version that link actually resolves,
 * or when two links load `effect` from different installed copies. Offline and
 * mock-free: the assertions read the exact manifests the runtime would load,
 * so an invalid lockfile peer resolution fails here instead of as a
 * FiberRefs/module-identity crash inside a spawned worker. The chain is
 * seeded with this plugin's own manifest because the worker script imports
 * `effect` directly, so plugin-level drift against the engine's pins is a
 * failure this gate must catch.
