# @elizaos/plugin-todos

Durable, tenant-scoped Todo lists for Eliza agents running in Node or on an
edge host such as Cloudflare Workers.

## What it does

The plugin gives an Eliza agent one `TODO` action for create, write, update,
complete, cancel, delete, list, and clear operations. `CURRENT_TODOS` adds the
user's active list to eligible planner turns in the `tasks`, `todos`, and
`automation` contexts.

Every mutating action is exactly-once at the storage boundary. The Todo change
and its immutable mutation receipt commit in the same Postgres transaction.
Retrying the same transport operation returns the original result as a replayed
no-op instead of changing state twice.

## Runtime entries

| Entry | Host | Storage | UI | Default role gates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@elizaos/plugin-todos` | Node `AgentRuntime` | `runtime.db` from `@elizaos/plugin-sql` | Includes `TodosView` | action `ADMIN`, provider `USER` |
| `@elizaos/plugin-todos/plugin` default | Node `AgentRuntime` | `runtime.db` from `@elizaos/plugin-sql` | Dashboard metadata, no React imports | action `ADMIN`, provider `USER` |
| `@elizaos/plugin-todos/edge` | Worker/edge `AgentRuntime` | Host-injected `TodoStore` | None | action/provider `GUEST` |

The named `todosRuntimePlugin` export remains a headless Node descriptor. Both
default Node entries use the same view declaration, so normal host loading via
`/plugin` discovers Todos without importing its React components.

The edge role gate is intended for a server-owned Shared-agent boundary. The
host must authenticate the principal and derive `agentId`, `entityId`, room,
world, and transport idempotency from trusted request state; the model does not
choose storage scope.

## Enable the Node plugin

Load SQL before Todos in the character's plugin list:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-todos"]
}
```

The runtime registers the package's Drizzle schema and `TodosService` wraps the
canonical SQL store.

## Enable the edge plugin

Create the host's Drizzle connection through its normal storage binding, apply
the canonical tables through the host migration pipeline, and inject the store:

```ts
import {
  createTodosEdgePlugin,
  createTodosSqlStore,
} from "@elizaos/plugin-todos/edge";

const store = createTodosSqlStore(db);
const plugin = createTodosEdgePlugin({ store });
```

Eliza Cloud supplies `db` through Hyperdrive. The edge entry imports no React,
dashboard bundle, Node filesystem API, or plugin-sql lifecycle service.

## Action operations

| Operation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `create` | Add one Todo; `content` is required and status defaults to `pending` |
| `write` | Reconcile the complete scoped list in one transaction |
| `update` | Patch content, status, active form, or parent; it can also detach a parent |
| `complete` | Transition one Todo to `completed` |
| `cancel` | Transition one Todo to `cancelled` |
| `delete` | Remove one Todo while preserving the original replay outcome |
| `list` | Read current Todos; no mutation receipt is written |
| `clear` | Remove Todos in the current trusted scope/room and preserve the original count for replay |

Todos support `parentTodoId` for hierarchy and `activeForm` for a
present-continuous display label such as "Adding tests." Todo requests are not
reminders: future delivery belongs to the canonical scheduling plugin and
runner.

## Storage and replay

The package owns one Drizzle schema with two tables:

- `todos.todos` stores the current tenant-scoped Todo graph.
- `todos.todo_mutations` stores the request digest and exact committed outcome,
  uniquely keyed by `(agentId, entityId, idempotencyKey)`.

`createTodosSqlStore` applies the same scope locks, hierarchy checks, replay
rules, and typed failures in every host. A reused key with different semantics
fails with `TODO_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`; storage failures never appear as a
healthy empty list.

## Cutover and identity continuity

The public store contract can atomically read Todo rows plus mutation records.
During cutover, the host materializes Todo rows and uses the exported
transaction helper to import their mutation records in the same transaction.
Another transaction helper converges two personal-agent scopes before identity
authority changes. Shared-to-Dedicated cutover therefore preserves Todo IDs,
parent IDs, mutation IDs, receipt IDs, and replay authority before routing
changes. Provisional phone-to-Telegram identity convergence uses the scope
helper before deleting the source identity. Target conflicts roll back the
entire operation.

## Public API

The default entry exports the Node plugin, UI, schema, `TodosService`, and the
canonical SQL-store helpers. The Worker-safe entry exports:

```ts
import {
  TODOS_EDGE_COMPATIBILITY,
  createTodosEdgePlugin,
  createTodosSqlStore,
  convergeTodoScopesInTransaction,
  importTodoMutationRecordsInTransaction,
  serializeTodoMutationRecord,
  deserializeTodoMutationRecord,
  type Todo,
  type TodoStore,
  type TodoMutationRecord,
  type TodoCutoverState,
} from "@elizaos/plugin-todos/edge";
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full extension and verification contract.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIZA_PARENT_TRAJECTORY_STEP_ID` | Adds trajectory provenance to newly created Todos | No |

No provider API key or plugin-specific secret is required.

## Verification

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-todos build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-todos typecheck
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-todos lint:check
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-todos test
```

The package suite includes real-PGlite coverage for tenant isolation,
concurrency, all mutators, exact replay, conflicts, atomic cutover import,
identity-scope convergence, and the packed Worker export.
