# `@elizaos/app-core`

Shared application core for elizaOS agent app shells (desktop, mobile, web). It bundles the pieces every shell needs: the CLI bootstrap, the dashboard HTTP API, the Eliza runtime loader, the static app/plugin/connector registry, auth/secrets/vault services, and per-platform bootstrap.

## What's in here

| Subdir          | Contains                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/entry.ts`  | CLI process bootstrap (built to `dist/entry.js`, imported by the generated app launcher).      |
| `src/cli/`      | Commander CLI: `start`, `setup`, `doctor`, `db`, `config`, `dashboard`, `update`, `auth`, …  |
| `src/api/`      | Dashboard HTTP API: server, auth/pairing routes, dev-stack discovery, secrets/wallet routes. |
| `src/runtime/`  | Eliza composition layer, focused startup lifecycle modules, dev server, runtime-mode, and Electrobun desktop runtimes. |
| `src/registry/` | Compatibility re-export of the canonical `@elizaos/registry/first-party` registry. |
| `src/security/` | Agent vault id + platform secure stores + wallet key hydration.                              |
| `src/services/` | Auth store, steward credentials/sidecar, vault mirror/bootstrap, account pool, and more.     |
| `src/platform/` | Per-platform bootstrap (Capacitor for mobile, browser stubs, native plugin entrypoints).     |
| `src/config/`   | `AppConfig` types and `DEFAULT_APP_CONFIG` (re-exported from `@elizaos/shared`).              |

## Usage

```ts
// Node/runtime barrel
import { startApiServer, loadRegistry, getPlugins } from "@elizaos/app-core";

// Targeted subpaths (see package.json exports for the full list)
import { loadRegistry } from "@elizaos/registry/first-party";
import { ensureRouteAuthorized } from "@elizaos/app-core/api/auth";
import { deriveAgentVaultId } from "@elizaos/app-core/security/agent-vault-id";
```

The full subpath list lives in the `exports` map of `package.json`.

## Build & test

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app-core build       # tsc → flatten → copy assets → rewrite dist ESM imports
bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
bun run --cwd packages/app-core test         # vitest
bun run --cwd packages/app-core lint         # Biome
```

This package supplies host integration to the `packages/app` shell and app-facing plugins. It targets Node `>=24`, with `react`/`react-dom`/`three` as peer dependencies and the `@elizaos/capacitor-*` mobile bridges as optional dependencies.

## Native inference setup

A normal root `bun install` initializes the pinned fused inference submodule,
ensures the host library and its companion libraries are current, and provisions
the hash-verified default embedding model. Setup then loads the native library
and computes a local embedding before reporting readiness. The runtime discovers these artifacts
under the same state directory without additional environment configuration.
Relative `ELIZA_STATE_DIR` paths resolve from the current working directory;
`~` expands to the user's home directory.

Reuse checks cover every staged native library, host architecture, and native
source changes. Missing or altered companions trigger a rebuild on install;
setup failures fail the install instead of reporting inference as ready.
`ELIZA_SKIP_FUSED_INFERENCE_SETUP=1` is an explicit escape hatch and does not
establish runtime readiness. Android and iOS packaging use their platform build
lanes to produce the corresponding NDK or Apple artifacts.


Android Bun runtime inputs for x64 and arm64 are pinned in
[`scripts/lib/android-bun-artifacts.lock.json`](scripts/lib/android-bun-artifacts.lock.json).
Both stable and canary channels resolve fixed GitHub release-asset IDs, archive
checksums, executable checksums, and source revisions. Staging verifies the
archive before extraction and the executable on every cache use; a mismatch
fails the build. Update the lock deliberately when changing runtime versions.
`ELIZA_BUN_X64_FILE` and `ELIZA_BUN_AARCH64_FILE` can supply downloaded ZIPs for
local or offline builds, and must match those same pins. RISC-V retains its
separate OS cross-build artifact and checksum contract.
