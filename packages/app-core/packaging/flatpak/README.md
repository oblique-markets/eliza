# Flatpak packaging status

The canonical desktop release workflow packages the already-built and tested
Electrobun Linux tree with
`packages/app-core/scripts/package-electrobun-flatpak.mjs`. The resulting
side-loadable `.flatpak` contains the same desktop runtime revision as the
AppImage, Debian, and RPM artifacts. It is installed and held through a
45-second launch-liveness check before release artifacts are uploaded.

On Linux, run the Electrobun build first and then use:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app-core build:flatpak:direct
```

The package is written under
`packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/artifacts/`.

## Linux sandbox contract

The direct Electrobun Linux artifacts and the Flatpak do not provide the same
isolation boundary:

- Electrobun `1.18.1` hard-codes CEF `no_sandbox` and appends
  `--no-sandbox` plus `--disable-gpu-sandbox` in its Linux native wrapper.
  The packaged `chrome-sandbox` helper therefore does not establish Chromium
  process isolation. See the pinned upstream
  [native wrapper](https://github.com/blackboardsh/electrobun/blob/v1.18.1/package/src/native/linux/nativeWrapper.cpp#L772-L781)
  and [CEF initialization](https://github.com/blackboardsh/electrobun/blob/v1.18.1/package/src/native/linux/nativeWrapper.cpp#L2308-L2314).
- `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, and unpacked Electrobun trees must not be called
  production-renderer-sandboxed. A real `bundleCEF: false` rebuild using the
  GTK/WebKit wrapper is the only acceptable way to evaluate a CEF-free direct
  artifact; editing packaged metadata does not change the selected wrapper.
- The Flatpak adds an independently enforced bubblewrap boundary around the
  whole application. This is an **outer Flatpak sandbox**, not a Chromium
  renderer sandbox and not defense in depth between compromised renderer and
  main process.

`linux-distribution-contract.mjs` rejects a stronger renderer-sandbox claim,
group/world-writable or escaping build entries, unknown changes in the pinned
CEF posture, and every Flatpak grant outside this exact allowlist:

```text
share:   network, ipc
socket:  wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio
device:  dri
command: eliza
```

It also verifies the finalized Flatpak metadata after `flatpak build-finish`,
so changing the requested arguments without changing the resulting metadata
cannot create a false pass. Run the static contract against the newest Linux
tree with:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app-core verify:linux-distribution
```

## GNU libc compatibility contract

Every installable Linux package now has a fail-closed GNU libc audit before
the first staging copy is made. The audit identifies ELF files by their magic
bytes, not their filenames, and runs `readelf -W --version-info` over every
one. That includes extensionless executables, native `.node` modules, and all
lazy-loaded local-inference `.so` files nested under `Resources`. Musl and
static ELF alternatives are still inspected; an ELF with no GLIBC version
requirements does not raise the GNU libc floor. Private or named GLIBC ABI
requirements fail closed.

The maximum accepted requirement is `GLIBC_2.38`. This ceiling comes from the
pinned Electrobun `1.18.1` Linux native wrapper, which already requires
`GLIBC_2.38`; it is the existing unavoidable direct-package floor, not a new
distro-support promise. Raising it in a fused or lazy-loaded library would make
parts of an otherwise launchable application fail only when that feature is
loaded. Lowering it below `2.38` requires rebuilding and qualifying the pinned
native wrapper as well as the fused libraries.

Both distribution entry points enforce the same complete-tree audit:

```bash
node packages/app-core/scripts/package-electrobun-linux.mjs \
  --build-dir=packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/build/dev-linux-x64/Eliza-dev
node packages/app-core/scripts/package-electrobun-flatpak.mjs \
  --build-dir=packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/build/dev-linux-x64/Eliza-dev
```

The contract is only an ELF ABI ceiling. It does not by itself qualify Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, or any other distribution: system WebKitGTK/GTK dependencies,
the selected Flatpak runtime, architecture, installation, and runtime behavior
must still be tested. In particular, do not claim Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility;
its libc predates the pinned wrapper's floor. Ubuntu 24.04 or a newer libc is
also not a completed compatibility claim without the remaining dependency and
runtime evidence.

The current release workflow still builds Linux inputs on the moving
`ubuntu-latest` runner label. Packaging will now reject an output that exceeds
the ceiling, but that runner label is not a reproducible builder contract. The
remaining production gate is to rebuild the full native and fused closure in a
pinned, immutable Linux builder whose libc is no newer than `2.38`, then run
this audit on the exact staged tree and exercise the resulting installers and
Flatpak. Do not use symbol-string editing, binary patching, or exclusions for
inference libraries to manufacture a pass.

### Runtime refs and disk preflight

The release default remains `org.gnome.Platform//49` with
`org.gnome.Sdk//49`. Reproducible local compatibility checks may supply full
refs explicitly; both refs must match the requested architecture:

```bash
node packages/app-core/scripts/package-electrobun-flatpak.mjs \
  --build-dir=packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/build/dev-linux-x64/Eliza-dev \
  --arch=x86_64 \
  --runtime-ref=org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/50 \
  --sdk-ref=org.freedesktop.Sdk/x86_64/25.08
```

Packaging intentionally refuses to start unless both the artifact/output
filesystem and the staging filesystem have free space equal to three
dereferenced allocated build copies plus a 1 GiB reserve. This covers the
independent staging tree, OSTree export, and final bundle without hard-linking
or mutating the tested source artifact.

On the 2026-08-22 Linux parity checkout, the tested tree measured
3,312,885,760 dereferenced allocated bytes (2,960,449,536 bytes from `du`
before dereferencing the five CEF library symlinks). The gate therefore
required 11,012,399,104 free bytes. The output filesystem had only
7,876,071,424 free bytes, so packaging stopped before a complete Flatpak could
be produced. A local Flatpak install, permission inspection, and 45-second
installed launch are consequently still unverified for that checkout. After
freeing space, run the command above, then exercise the same install lane used
by CI:

```bash
bundle=packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/artifacts/Eliza-2.0.3-beta.7-linux-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak install --user --noninteractive -y --reinstall "$bundle"
flatpak info --user --show-permissions ai.elizaos.app
timeout 45s xvfb-run --auto-servernum \
  --server-args="-screen 0 1280x900x24 -nolisten tcp" \
  flatpak run ai.elizaos.app
```

The expected `timeout` exit is `124`; any earlier exit fails the liveness
contract. The installed permission output must still match the allowlist
above.

## Flathub is not yet eligible

The current release packager produces the Electrobun desktop application for
side-loading. A compliant offline Flathub source manifest is not available.

`bun run --cwd packages/app-core build:flatpak:store` deliberately fails
closed. Before enabling it, all of the following must be true:

1. A human maintainer has resolved Flathub's generative-AI submission policy
   for this repository and obtained any required exception.
2. The manifest builds the real Electrobun application and all dependencies
   offline from immutable, checksum-pinned sources.
3. The selected reverse-DNS app ID is controlled and verified by the publisher.
4. Current AppStream metadata, screenshots, permissions, and portal behavior
   pass Flathub review and the official linter.
5. A human authors and submits the Flathub application materials. Automation
   may test the repository artifact, but it must not generate or submit the
   application on that person's behalf.
