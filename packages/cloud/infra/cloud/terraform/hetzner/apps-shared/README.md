# elizaOS Cloud Apps — environment database infrastructure

This root provisions one private network, PostgreSQL host, PGDATA volume,
firewall and database credentials for **one** of development, staging or
production. Its name remains `apps-shared` because workers within that
environment share the database host; environments must not share it.

Use a separate Hetzner apps project and `eliza-terraform-state-<environment>`
R2 bucket for each environment. Copy the matching
`tfvars/<environment>.tfvars.example` and initialize with
`backend-<environment>.hcl`. The required `environment` input is published
in state; `apps-data-plane` rejects any missing or mismatched identity.

The historical `backend.hcl` records the prior shared state location for
migration readback. Do not initialize the current root against it or migrate
that state into a new environment backend. Use the reviewed historical source
for legacy resource administration until retirement.

## Migration and admission

1. Inventory and back up the existing shared tenant databases, roles, volume,
   encryption keys and routing authority. Prove a restore before cutover.
2. Provision new environment projects and bucket-scoped state credentials.
   Plan this root against each new backend; the reviewed plan must create
   isolated resources without modifying the old database, volume or network.
3. Copy each environment's data and roles to its new database. Re-encrypt DSNs
   with that environment's secrets and seed only its `tenant_db_clusters` rows.
4. Validate own-tenant reads/writes, cross-tenant and cross-environment rejection,
   backup capture and an isolated restore. Fence writes for final synchronization.
5. Switch database authority and app routing under the existing lifecycle
   controls. Preserve the old resources for a verified rollback window; their
   retirement requires a separate ownership and retention review.

Changing Terraform state does not move data or rewrite deployed credentials.
The nightly backup implementation below does not meet the production plan's
five-minute PITR target; continuous WAL backup and measured recovery remain
required before production acceptance.

## Continuous tenant WAL backup

`pitr_repository` accepts a complete endpoint hostname, bucket, region,
access key, secret key and encryption key. It defaults to null. Supply it only
for a dedicated repository outside the application failure domain, with keys
recoverable independently of this host. The bucket must differ from both
Terraform state and the logical-dump expiry bucket. Values are sensitive but
remain in Terraform state and cloud-init user data; restrict both accordingly.

With this bundle, new-host cloud-init installs pgBackRest, enables synchronous
encrypted WAL upload with TLS verification and a 60-second WAL switch timeout,
creates the stanza and verifies archiving before taking the initial full backup.
Weekly full and daily differential timers follow. A recurring check exercises
archive delivery and fails visibly in systemd if delivery does not complete.
No WAL queue-size discard cutoff is configured. Storage exhaustion and failed
checks still require the production alert integration. The check also rejects
missing, failed or previous-generation backup receipts, a latest completed
backup older than 26 hours, a full backup older than nine days, and timestamps
in the future. These are schedule-health thresholds, not RPO measurements.
An explicit empty config-include directory prevents unrelated pgBackRest
configuration fragments from overriding the managed repository settings.

Automatic expiry is disabled until independently scoped deletion authority and
restore proof are in place. The configured 30-day retention is the proposed
policy for that later expiry activation; it does not currently delete data.
This does not establish a five-minute RPO or a successful remote restore.
Read back PostgreSQL's effective settings, completed backup metadata, archive
checks and a separate restored cluster before declaring recovery available.

Cloud-init is a new-host bootstrap. Changing this variable must not be treated
as an in-place activation procedure for existing data hosts. Review the plan
for replacement, preserve the original host/volume, and perform the earlier
write-fenced migration procedure. A Linux host drill, backup-age monitoring,
alert delivery and actual off-host credentials remain required before release.

Run `terraform init -backend=false`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform test`
for local configuration checks. Tests use mocked provider effects; live
provider plans, connectivity and recovery evidence remain separate requirements.

## Bootstrap and empty-cluster initialization

The host installs PostgreSQL 16 for the Ubuntu 24.04 image and validates the
existing cluster's major before starting it. Bootstrap uses the exact volume
ID supplied by Terraform, requires an ext4 filesystem, and verifies the mounted
block-device identity. It never formats a volume. Missing attachment or package
readiness is a failure retried by systemd, rather than a healthy empty host.

The PostgreSQL cluster unit independently checks the assigned mount, cluster major
and effective data directory before every start. Package hooks and early reboot
starts fail closed until bootstrap has prepared the matching volume.

A new empty volume needs a one-use authorization after its creation and identity
have been verified in the reviewed plan/provider receipt. On that candidate host,
use the new volume ID from that receipt in this root command:

```bash
sudo bash -s -- /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0HC_Volume_REPLACE_WITH_NEW_VOLUME_ID <<'SH'
set -euo pipefail
volume_device="$1"
[[ "$volume_device" =~ ^/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0HC_Volume_[0-9]+$ ]]
test -b "$volume_device"
systemctl stop tenant-db-init.service
test ! -L /run/eliza-tenant-db-init
install -d -m 0700 -o root -g root /run/eliza-tenant-db-init
test ! -e /run/eliza-tenant-db-init/authorization.consumed
umask 077
set -o noclobber
printf '%s\n' "$volume_device" > /run/eliza-tenant-db-init/authorization
systemctl start tenant-db-init.service
SH
```

The receipt expires after five minutes, is bound to that exact volume and is
consumed atomically before `initdb`. It is not recreated on reboot. A failed
initialization leaves its consumed receipt and partial data intact; inspect and
recover them instead of issuing another authorization blindly. Existing clusters
do not need this receipt. Unknown directories, mismatched versions and recovered
filesystem entries stop initialization and require the appropriate restore or
migration path. Systemd/SSH/database readiness still needs a real host drill;
local shell tests substitute those external boundaries.

## Connection pooling (pgbouncer) — #8321 P0 #2

The default Postgres ceiling (100 connections) exhausts at ~5 apps under load.
The tenant-db cloud-init now (a) raises `max_connections` to 500 + sizes
`shared_buffers` to ~25% of the node's RAM, and (b) runs **pgbouncer in SESSION
`pool_mode` on `:6432`** in front of Postgres, so app sessions are multiplexed
onto a bounded set of server backends.

**Why session mode (not transaction):** plugin-sql's runtime migrator takes
**session-scoped** advisory locks (`pg_advisory_lock`, not the `_xact_`
variants) across independent pool checkouts. Transaction pooling would acquire
the lock on one backend and release it on another, orphaning it and wedging
migrations. Session mode is the safe drop-in; a future transaction-mode move
would first require reworking that lock path.

The pooler authenticates per-tenant roles via `auth_query` against a
`SECURITY DEFINER` lookup (`public.pgbouncer_user_lookup`) owned by `postgres`
and execute-granted only to the `pgbouncer` role — so the pooler resolves SCRAM
secrets without being a superuser. The app's `REVOKE CONNECT` isolation still
gates every connection.

### Operator rollout (the pooler is INERT until you do step 2)

1. **Roll the tenant-db node** so the new cloud-init runs (installs + configures
   pgbouncer). `user_data` is under `lifecycle.ignore_changes`, and
   `lifecycle.prevent_destroy` deliberately blocks `terraform taint` or
   `-replace` from destroying the server. Use a separately reviewed maintenance
   change that temporarily removes only the server guard, keeps the PGDATA
   volume and network guarded, and proves in its exact plan that only the
   intended VM is replaced. The replacement is a disruptive restart; restore
   the server guard immediately afterward. (Currently gated on the staging
   Hetzner server limit — see #8318.)
2. **Route apps through the pooler:** set the `tenant_db_clusters.host` column
   (the **app-facing** per-tenant DSN host) to the `tenant_db_pooler_endpoint`
   output (`10.30.1.10:6432`). New per-tenant DSNs then point at the pooler;
   the **admin/DDL** DSN (`tenant_db_admin_dsn`) stays on `:5432` — role/database
   DDL must not go through the pooler. The DB ambassador forwards whatever port
   the DSN carries, so no app-side change is needed.
3. **Validate:** `psql "<a tenant DSN with :6432>"` connects; `SHOW POOLS;` on
   the pgbouncer admin console shows session pools; `journalctl -u pgbouncer`.

## Outputs

- `apps_network_id` — for `hcloud_server_network` in apps-data-plane.
- `apps_subnet_id` — informational.
- `apps_subnet_cidr` — apps-data-plane uses this to compute app node private IPs.
- `tenant_db_private_ip` — `10.30.1.10`, stable.
- `tenant_db_public_ip` — SSH/admin only.
- `tenant_db_admin_dsn` — **sensitive**; seed into `tenant_db_clusters` (`:5432`, direct).
- `tenant_db_pooler_endpoint` — `10.30.1.10:6432`; set as `tenant_db_clusters.host` to route apps through pgbouncer (after rolling the node).
- `tenant_db_backup_configured` — `true` when the complete off-host backup credential bundle is supplied. This configuration output does not prove capture, remote verification, or restore success.

## Off-host encrypted recovery — #21729

### Authority and data classification

This module's tenant Postgres node is the authority for this environment's
app tenant databases (per-tenant `DATABASE`+`ROLE`, `REVOKE CONNECT FROM
PUBLIC`). The data is customer-owned application data — treat it as
confidential. This README, the terraform files, and all job logs must never
carry credentials, DSN values, host secrets, or tenant identifiers; tenant
database names exist only inside the encrypted archive (`dbmap.tsv`), and the
nightly job logs counts/bytes/durations only.

### Recovery objectives

- **RPO: 26 hours** (one nightly backup at 02:15 UTC plus randomized delay and
  slack). Anything written after the last nightly set is lost in a full-node
  loss — an explicitly accepted alpha-scale bound.
- **RTO: 60 minutes** for a rebuild-from-backup onto a fresh isolated node at
  current data volume, measured by the drill harness (below). Re-baseline the
  target as tenant data grows.
- **HA posture:** the node is deliberately single-instance (accepted bounded
  risk at alpha scale). The tested compensations are the protected PGDATA
  volume (survives server rebuilds), Hetzner host snapshots, and the off-host
  encrypted sets with drilled restore timing. Streaming replication/failover
  is a follow-up that must not be improvised during an incident.

### Backup pipeline (armed by terraform variables)

Set `backup_s3_endpoint`, `backup_s3_bucket`, `backup_s3_prefix`,
`backup_s3_access_key`, `backup_s3_secret_key`,
`backup_encryption_passphrase`, and `backup_retention_days` together (a
partial set fails the plan). The bucket must live outside the Hetzner apps
project (e.g. a dedicated R2 bucket) and must never be the terraform state
bucket. Encryption ownership: the archive is AES-256 (PBKDF2) encrypted **on
the node before upload**, so the bucket operator never holds tenant plaintext;
the passphrase lives in the org password manager (cloud-ops vault) and is a
hard dependency for every restore — losing it loses every off-host backup.

Each nightly set under `<prefix>/<UTC stamp>/` holds:

- `backup.tar.gz.enc` — encrypted tar of `pg_dumpall --globals-only`, one
  `pg_dump -Fc` per non-template database (keyed by truncated name hash),
  `dbmap.tsv`, `manifest.json`, and `checksums.sha256`.
- `backup.json` — plaintext sidecar (archive sha256, byte size, database
  count, cipher, timestamp) so freshness/integrity alerting and drills can
  verify the set without the passphrase.

The script streams the stored ciphertext back and compares its SHA-256 before publishing `backup.json`. It then verifies the stored metadata before pruning expired sets. Any failed read or checksum mismatch exits unsuccessfully and preserves older sets. Remote readback proves stored bytes; an isolated database restore is still required to prove recovery.

Retention pruning runs in the same job. Because `user_data` is under
`lifecycle.ignore_changes`, the existing node picks up the pipeline via the
guarded replacement procedure above (or by applying the rendered cloud-init
sections by hand during a maintenance window).

### Restore drills (recurring)

Run at least monthly, and after any Postgres/pgbouncer config change:

1. Download the newest set from the bucket to an operator machine or a
   throwaway VM with an **isolated** Postgres instance (never the live node).
2. Initialize a disposable Postgres target with a unique bootstrap superuser
   that does not exist in the source archive (for example
   `eliza_restore_admin_<uuid>`), plus pgbouncer. A default target containing
   the source `postgres` role is intentionally refused before destructive SQL:
   strict `pg_dumpall --globals-only` replay cannot safely ignore role
   collisions. Generate a one-use identity (`drill-<uuid>`) and set it on the
   Postgres server:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET eliza.restore_target_id =
     'drill-11111111-2222-4333-8444-555555555555';
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
   ```

   The harness inventories existing target roles before restore and refuses
   any collision with `globals.sql`. It also verifies the server-side identity
   in the same psql session before globals, each database drop/create, and each
   database's rendered pg_restore SQL. Restore sessions use `--no-psqlrc`, and
   the harness renders without pg_restore `--create`, so no unguarded reconnect
   exists. A DNS alias, alternate address, or SSH tunnel cannot redirect a
   later destructive connection to another server. The identity is genuinely
   one-use: the harness's very first guarded session both verifies it and
   clears it (`ALTER SYSTEM RESET` + `pg_reload_conf()`), so a second run —
   accidental re-invocation or a racing process — observes an unset setting
   and fails closed with `REFUSED_TARGET_AUTHORITY` rather than replaying the
   same nonce. Still generate a fresh identity per drill and destroy the
   target afterward.

3. Prepare a root-readable `tenant-probes.json` that covers every opaque dump
   id in `dbmap.tsv` and references password environment variables rather
   than containing passwords or database names:

   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": 1,
     "tenants": [
       {
         "dump_id": "0123456789ab",
         "role": "restored_tenant_role",
         "password_env": "DRILL_TENANT_1_PASSWORD"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Export each referenced variable from the protected operator secret source.
   The restored SCRAM hashes authenticate those real roles; values are passed
   to libpq only through `PGPASSWORD` and never enter arguments or reports.

4. Run the harness:

   ```bash
   bun packages/cloud/scripts/admin/apps-tenant-db-recovery.ts \
     --set-dir <downloaded-set> \
     --target-dsn postgresql://eliza_restore_admin:...@127.0.0.1:5433/postgres \
     --target-id drill-11111111-2222-4333-8444-555555555555 \
     --pooler-endpoint 127.0.0.1:6432 \
     --tenant-probes-file <path> --passphrase-file <path> \
     --rpo-hours 26 --rto-minutes 60 --output drill-report.json
   ```

   It fails the globals restore on the first SQL error, restores each database,
   then authenticates every tenant role to its own database through both direct
   Postgres and pgbouncer and requires every cross-tenant connection to fail.
   Each successful own connection must also return the one-use target identity.
   The report contains only opaque dump ids/counts and measured RPO/RTO; the
   process exits `2` when objectives are missed.
5. File the redacted `drill-report.json` with the ops evidence for the run and
   destroy the verification instance (the harness already shreds its decrypted
   workspace).

### Staging isolation and production cutover (dual-readiness)

Provisioning a physically separate staging tenant DB precedes any production
authority change: bring up a second node from this module's cloud-init in a
staging-scoped state root, point staging `tenant_db_clusters` rows at it, and
prove a full drill against it. Production cutover then requires reviewed plan
artifacts from the protected `Infrastructure` workflow, both databases passing
the drill (dual readiness), an authority switch done via the
`tenant_db_clusters` rows (reversible by pointing the rows back), and no
credential values in any log or plan output. Post-cutover rollback keeps the
old node intact and guarded until a verified off-host restore of the new
authority exists.

## Persistent-resource safeguards and rollback

The shared tenant Postgres VM has Hetzner backups plus delete and rebuild
protection. Its attached PGDATA volume and private network have delete
protection. Provider backups are a short-term host safeguard only: they do not
provide application-consistent Postgres recovery, point-in-time recovery, or
environment isolation. Those require a separate reviewed design and recurring
restore proof.

The server, volume, and network also use Terraform
`lifecycle.prevent_destroy`. Hetzner's provider removes API delete protection
when Terraform intentionally destroys a resource, so provider protection alone
does not block an accidental replacement from an apply. Removing a resource
block also removes the lifecycle guard and requires a separately reviewed
retirement plan.

Before any apply, run the protected `Infrastructure` workflow with
`component=apps-shared`, `environment=production`, and `operation=plan`, then
review the exact bound plan artifact. Adoption should be in-place. Any server,
volume, or network replacement is a stop condition.

Rollback must preserve the data dependency order: keep volume and network
lifecycle guards and delete protection enabled while the database uses them;
remove the server lifecycle guard or rebuild protection only for an explicitly
reviewed replacement; and remove volume or network guards only in a later
retirement plan after a verified off-host restore. Never detach or destroy the
volume as a shortcut for rolling back backup billing.
