# hetzner/control-plane — Terraform for the eliza Cloud control-plane VMs

This Terraform module manages the **persistent** Hetzner Cloud VM(s) that host
the elizaOS Cloud control-plane:

- `eliza-provisioning-worker` — pulls jobs from the `jobs` table and SSHs
  into sandbox cores
- `eliza-agent-router` — subdomain HTTP routing
- `nginx` — public ingress: the agent-router vhost (self-signed wildcard
  cert; cloud-init) and the headscale vhost (Let's Encrypt; converged by
  `arm-headscale-control-plane.yml`)
- `headscale` — VPN mesh for cross-core agent traffic

The **data plane** (the sandbox cores themselves) is **not** managed here —
those are provisioned and drained at runtime by
[`node-autoscaler.ts`](../../../../../shared/src/lib/services/containers/node-autoscaler.ts)
which talks to the Hetzner Cloud API directly. See
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full split.

## Prerequisites

1. **Hetzner Cloud project** with API token (`HCLOUD_TOKEN`).
2. **Cloudflare account** with API token + DNS edit on `eliza.app` and the
   transitional `elizacloud.ai` zone
   (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
3. **Cloudflare R2 bucket** `eliza-terraform-state` for remote state. Generate
   an R2 API token, edit `backend-staging.hcl` / `backend-production.hcl`
   with your CF account ID, then export the R2 token as
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` before `terraform init`.
4. **Terraform >= 1.10.0** locally.

## Bootstrap a brand-new control-plane VM (staging)

```bash
cd packages/cloud/infra/cloud/terraform/hetzner/control-plane

# 1. Pull providers + connect remote state.
terraform init -backend-config=backend-staging.hcl

# 2. Copy + fill tfvars.
cp tfvars/staging.tfvars.example tfvars/staging.tfvars
$EDITOR tfvars/staging.tfvars

# 3. Plan + apply.
export HCLOUD_TOKEN=...
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars/staging.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=tfvars/staging.tfvars

# 4. Output gives you the VM IP. Copy the cloud env file into place:
scp packages/cloud/shared/.env.local root@<vm-ip>:/opt/eliza/cloud/.env.local

# 5. Trigger first deploy from GitHub Actions
#    (workflow: deploy-eliza-provisioning-worker.yml, manual dispatch).
```

## Development control-plane provisioning

Development uses `tfvars/development.tfvars.example`, its own Hetzner project,
and `backend-development.hcl`. Create the dedicated
`eliza-terraform-state-development` R2 bucket and use credentials scoped to that
bucket before initializing state. Never initialize development against an
existing staging or production state key.

The module creates development Headscale DNS records without importing a
legacy record from another tier. Both Headscale hostnames must match the selected
environment, and a development host must follow `develop`. Development workflow
admission and service configuration must be wired before operational use; this
module alone does not establish a working cloud tier.

Run the Terraform boundary tests without cloud credentials:

```bash
terraform init -backend=false -input=false
terraform validate
terraform test
```

These tests exercise the real Terraform graph with mocked provider operations;
they do not provision hosts or prove live routing, database, or credential
isolation. A real reviewed plan and subsequent runtime readback remain required.

## Adopt the existing production VM into Terraform

The current prod manager VM (`89.167.63.246`, a legacy hand-assigned
hostname) was created by hand in May 2026. To bring it under Terraform
without recreating it, look up the Hetzner Cloud server ID
(`hcloud server list`), then `terraform import 'hcloud_server.control_plane["1"]' <id>`
plus a `terraform import` for each existing `hcloud_ssh_key`. The first
plan after import shows the in-place rename to `eliza-production-1` (the
env-suffixed name), the new labels, and the Cloudflare DNS record creation;
`user_data` and `image`
diffs are suppressed by `lifecycle { ignore_changes }`. One-shot — never
re-run.

## Operational notes

**SSH to the CP — always by public IP, never by hostname.** The Cloudflare DNS
canonical record (`eliza-${env}-N.eliza.app`) is proxied (orange-cloud); CF does not
pass TCP/22, so `ssh root@eliza-staging-1.eliza.app` silently fails. Get the
IP from terraform output:

```bash
terraform output -json control_plane_vms | jq -r '."1".ipv4'
# Or the ready-made command:
terraform output ssh_login_commands
```

**Cloudflare zone SSL mode MUST stay on "Full"** (not "Full (Strict)"). The
control-plane uses a self-signed certificate covering `*.eliza.app` and the
temporary legacy zone; CF only accepts that
on "Full". Flipping to Strict in the CF dashboard breaks every dashboard
chat call silently with HTTP 526.

**DNS cutover is operator-gated, not automatic.** The control-plane A record
has `lifecycle.ignore_changes = [content]` so `terraform apply` never auto-
flips the IP when a new VM gets created. When the new CP is validated, flip
the record manually via the Cloudflare dashboard (preferred — no NXDOMAIN
window) or via a one-off `terraform state rm` + re-apply round-trip if you
want the new content to land back in state.

**Cloud-init changes require a separately reviewed replacement** to land on
existing VMs. `user_data` is in `lifecycle.ignore_changes`, and
`lifecycle.prevent_destroy` deliberately blocks `terraform taint` or
`-replace` from destroying an existing CP. A replacement maintenance change
must temporarily remove the server's lifecycle guard, preserve the network
guard, and prove in its exact plan that only the intended VM is replaced. That
replacement wipes local state (Headscale DB, TLS certificates, and the
`/opt/eliza` checkout), so copy and verify state before the apply and restore
the guard immediately afterward.

**Headscale arm/handoff on a CP.** Cloud-init installs the `headscale` package
(binary, systemd unit, `/var/lib/headscale` state dir owned by the package user)
but stops the auto-started service so it does not bind with a fresh empty DB
before the environment is intentionally wired.

For the normal staging/prod path, use the idempotent workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run arm-headscale-control-plane.yml --repo elizaOS/eliza --ref main \
  -f environment=production -f operation=converge
```

Staging legacy-vhost retirement is a separate two-run operation documented in
`packages/cloud/services/headscale/DEPLOY.md`. The retirement dispatch must
include the exact lowercase SHA-256 printed by its preceding read-only
inspection; do not retire against an unbound or stale review.

That workflow installs the committed ACL, converges `server_url` and the fixed
environment-specific loopback `listen_addr`, ensures the `agent`/`tunnel`
users exist, upserts the daemon's
Headscale env in `/opt/eliza/cloud/.env.local`, restarts both services, and
checks local `/health`. It also converges the last-mile public-edge bits that
used to be hand-run on every CP (and lost on a rebuild — a DR gap):

- the **nginx vhost + Let's Encrypt cert** that front the public headscale URL
  (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/headscale.conf` → `127.0.0.1:<listen-port>`), as a
  no-http2 vhost with `Upgrade`/`Connection` passthrough + 86400s timeouts (the
  TS2021/noise control protocol needs it). Renewal rides the required
  `certbot.timer`; a root-owned deploy hook verifies the renewed leaf still has
  both exact SANs and validates nginx before reloading it. Cert issuance is
  idempotent (`certbot certonly`, skipped when a valid cert already exists).
- the **`cp-<env>-router` tailscale self-enrollment** (`tag:eliza-proxy`, owned
  by the `tunnel` user) so the daemon on the CP can reach agent `tag:agent`
  `100.64.x` IPs. Idempotent (skips if already enrolled).

The matching canonical **DNS record** (`headscale[-staging].eliza.app` → CP
ipv4, `proxied=false`) is managed by this Terraform module
(`cloudflare_dns_record.canonical_headscale` in `main.tf`), set via the
`canonical_headscale_hostname` tfvar. The legacy record remains during cutover. So the
full chain — DNS, nginx, cert, cp-router — now reproduces from IaC on a clean CP
rebuild (`terraform apply` for DNS, then the arm workflow for the rest). See
[`../../../../../services/headscale/DEPLOY.md`](../../../../../services/headscale/DEPLOY.md)
for the required GitHub Environment secrets and the "why" behind each one.

If you are replacing a CP and must preserve an existing tailnet, copy the state
first, then run the arm workflow to converge config and daemon env:

```bash
# From the prior CP
ssh root@PRIOR_CP 'sudo tar czf /tmp/hs.tgz -C /var/lib/headscale db.sqlite noise_private.key'
scp root@PRIOR_CP:/tmp/hs.tgz /tmp/hs.tgz

# Push to NEW CP
scp /tmp/hs.tgz deploy@NEW_CP:/tmp/
ssh deploy@NEW_CP '
  sudo systemctl stop headscale || true
  sudo tar xzf /tmp/hs.tgz -C /var/lib/headscale
  sudo chown -R headscale:headscale /var/lib/headscale
'
```

Why the workflow comes after the state copy: `server_url`, ACL path, API URL,
and daemon env are environment-specific. Reusing the prior host's
`config.yaml` risks advertising the wrong coordination server and recreating
the exact "node registers against the wrong service" failure mode.

## What this module does NOT manage (yet)

- Headscale state (preauth keys/API key rotation) — manual via `headscale`
  CLI; config + ACL + daemon env + the public nginx vhost / LE cert / the
  `cp-<env>-router` self-enrollment are all converged by
  `arm-headscale-control-plane.yml`. The headscale public **DNS record** IS
  managed here (`cloudflare_dns_record.headscale`).
- The systemd units — installed by `deploy-eliza-provisioning-worker.yml`
  on every push.
- The actual eliza Cloud sandbox cores (data plane) — runtime autoscale.

These are tracked as follow-ups in
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md#followups).

## Persistent-resource safeguards

Each control-plane VM has Hetzner backups plus delete and rebuild protection,
and Terraform attaches it to the same protected private network used by its
runtime-created workers. These provider backups reduce host-loss recovery time;
they do not replace an application-consistent backup of Headscale state or the
control-plane daemon configuration.

The persistent server and network also use Terraform
`lifecycle.prevent_destroy`. Hetzner's provider removes API delete protection
when Terraform intentionally destroys a resource, so provider protection alone
does not prevent an accidental replacement from an apply. Removing the
resource block itself also removes the lifecycle guard; configuration deletion
therefore requires the same separately reviewed retirement plan.

Always dispatch `Infrastructure` with `operation=plan` from the canonical
branch for the selected protected environment and review the exact bound plan
artifact before an apply. The first adoption plan should contain only in-place
protection/backup updates plus one subnet-specific network attachment per
control-plane VM; a server replacement, network replacement, or DNS change is
a stop condition.

Rollback is intentionally ordered and requires a separately reviewed plan:

1. Keep delete/rebuild protection enabled while validating public ingress,
   Headscale, and daemon health.
2. Detach the private-network resource only after proving no daemon or worker
   route depends on it.
3. Disable backups only after an independent state-backup/recovery path is
   proven and the recurring-cost change is accepted.
4. Remove `lifecycle.prevent_destroy`, rebuild protection, and delete
   protection only through an explicitly reviewed replacement or retirement
   change; restore every retained resource's lifecycle guard immediately after
   the operation.

Never use an ad-hoc provider mutation to bypass protection. A protected
resource that Terraform cannot update cleanly must stop at plan review.

## Cost

| Component                    | Resource    | Monthly (€) |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1× cpx32 (4 vCPU / 8 GB) x86 | control VM  | ~11         |
| 1× IPv4 + IPv6               | floating IP | included    |
| Cloudflare R2 state          | < 100 KB    | 0           |
| **Total per environment**    |             | **~11**     |

The default is `cpx32` since Hetzner retired `cpx21` in `fsn1`. Production VM
`eliza-production-1` runs x86 `cpx32`, the same type as staging. Moving the
control plane to ARM (`cax`-series, ~€7/mo) is a possible future cost
optimization, not current state — it needs the cloud-init arm64 templating fix
tracked as a followup first.

A 2nd control-plane VM (HA, currently unused) doubles the line. The
**data-plane autoscale** cost is separate and elastic.
