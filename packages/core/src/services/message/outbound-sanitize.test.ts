/**
 * Characterization tests for `sanitizeOutboundText` — the shared outbound
 * sanitizer moved from the Discord-local pre-send sanitizer (plugin-discord
 * `reasoning-tags.ts`, #15812 → #15888). The corpus locks the Discord
 * semantics (paired, unclosed, nested, malformed, and adversarial tag shapes;
 * fenced-code preservation; sentinel removal; whitespace collapse;
 * idempotence) so the move to `packages/core` is behavior-preserving for
 * every connector, and pins the four deliberate deltas fixed at the promotion
 * moment: the lone-`eot_id` pre-filter gap, `$`-replacement-pattern corruption
 * during fence restore, blank-line collapse inside restored fences, and
 * inline code-span protection. Each delta has a dedicated test naming it.
